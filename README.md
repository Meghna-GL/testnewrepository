# Hostel-Management-System

## Description

- Hostel Management System manages data of students, staff, students' representative, admission process, mess and also helps in maintaining exit-entry records of students who stay in the hostel, visitors and couriers delivered to them.

- It also allows students to complain to the admin directly and get their query resolved.

- All the announcements related to the hostel can be read by all types of users on their dashboards.

- This system is designed in favour of the hostel management which helps them carry out all the above mentioned manual tasks without being present there.

- It does not require the person handling the system to be very efficient or to be good at calculations. It aids in efficiently managing the hostel.
